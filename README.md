## FAQ Section


- ``Is it safe to run the app as admin ?``
Yes if you get it from our official TIRTAGT-DEV GitHub organization, No if you get it from any other source. Still not trust us ? Compile the project your own !

- ``Why not using Task Manager ?``
You can't really see all properties in task manager, This app is able to catch the app and save the information even though the target app is closed or inactive !

- ``What is the example use case ?``
Do you have an apps that run chromium in kiosk mode and had disabled all control functions so that you can't even use task manager ? This app got you covered, Track the chromium launch command line argument and save it for you to review later. This allow us to easily "log" process information when needed.

- ``Any Tutorial video on the example use case ?``
Yep, I'm currently creating a video about this app and will later upload it to YouTube ! I will be using this app to grab a "URL" and "HTTP UserAgent" from my school annoying Exam Browser and later use Opera GX as the Exam Browser.
